            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>My name is Araceli García and I am originally from Barcelona, Spain, but I am currently living in the Cayman Islands. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When I finished high school I started studying English & German Translation and Interpreting in University, however during my third year I realized I didn't see myself working as either a translator or an interpreter, so I decided to study something different. 
                <br>
                <br>
                After one sabbatical year trying to figure out what I would like to study I started a Bachelor's Degree in Tourism and Hotel Management, which I finished in 2018, which is when I moved to the Cayman Islands to work at the Kimpton Seafire Resort & Spa -a gorgeous, gorgeous hotel in the Caribbean.
                <br>
                <br>
                When COVID-19 hit in 2020 and the tourism industry suffered a major setback I started doing market reasearch to find new career paths and opportunities. By then I was about to turn 30 years old and after having been able to sustain myself since 20 years old, feeling like all of that could change and I would have to go back to my parents' place, amongst others, was very scary. So I decided to learn a new skill and develop myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2022 I got offered a job at Cayman Enterprise City as a Projects Coordinator -position I still hold. CEC is a company that operates in the Special Economic Zone and hosts over 300 companies from all around the world -most of these companies being tech, such as Chainlink, Sol, Fat Shark, Brave, Avalanch, RealVision, etc.
